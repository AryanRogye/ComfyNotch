## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **macOS Compatibility**  
   - ComfyNotch only supports macOS 14 (Sonoma) and above.  
   - ComfyNotch also uses Metal for rendering, which is not available on macOS 13 and below.
   - Users on macOS 13 and below may experience crashes or missing functionalities.  
   - No plans for backward compatibility, but feel free to open an issue if needed.  

2. ** Monitor Switching (Solved) **  
   - Switching monitors causes the app to lose positioning, not returning to the laptop screen.  
   - Resolving this is also a priority.  

3. **Scroll Logic (for most MacOS)**

## 👏🏽 Fixed Issues
1. **Display Issues**  
   - After closing and reopening the laptop, the app display may appear distorted or glitchy.  
   - Fixing this is a priority once I know how to lol.
